# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
# to change depending on the environment.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in

# !example_override.tf
